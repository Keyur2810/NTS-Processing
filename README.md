----
National Travel Survey Processing (NTS) is Transport for the North's (TfN) suite of tools to build an NTS dataset from raw inputs via a special data licence supplied by the UK Data Service. Furthermore, there are a multitiude of outputs these tools build, where the vast majority are inputs for the production model of TfN's Travel Marker Synthesiser within [NorMITs-Demand](https://github.com/Transport-for-the-North/NorMITs-Demand#travel-market-synthesiser)

## Overview
A suite of tools to read in NTS raw data using its hierarchical data format and joins tables to create an 'unclassified build'.
It then classfies this build based on classifications relevant to TfN's Analtitical Framework models.
Using classified build, we create trip rates, mode time splits and productions - reporting comparisons of these data sets to CTripEnd.

## Backlog
Non-homebased trip rates and time splits
