# NTS-Processing

In the current main there are inconsistencies between files for how each value is matched.
If this is not intentional, its possible that some of these values are incorrect.
To ensure that values are consistent between files I suggest pulling the values from a lookup file (or from a lookup table on postgres)
If this is intentional feel free to remove this branch.

(This is in the readme instead of in a note on a pull request because this branch is incomplete)
