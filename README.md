National Travel Survey analysis routines

## Overview
A suite of tools to read in NTS raw data using its hierarchical data format and joins tables to create an 'unclassified build'.
It then classfies this build based on classifications relevant to TfN's Analtitical Framework models.
Using classified build, we create trip rates, mode time splits and productions - reporting comparisons of these data sets to CTripEnd.

## Backlog
Non-homebased trip rates and time splits
